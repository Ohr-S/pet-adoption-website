            <br />
            <h4>1.Life Balance - It is essential you schedule time in your calendar for you, your dog, and your family.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4>2.Foster Good Self Esteem - Pet owners need to be careful to let their dog work out problems for themselves.  Do not micromanage or help them too much.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4>3.Set Limits - Just like children, dogs thrive on rules and structure.  Your dog should have a clear and consistent set of rules that everyone in the house follows with the dog.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4>4.Management vs Relationship - While it is very important to have limits, not every interaction should be obedience.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4>5.Responsibility - Responsibility goes both ways.  It is up to you to learn how to positively train your dog so he understands what you want.</h4>
            <br />
            <h4>6.Giving Space - Dogs need space to be a dog. Keep the fun walks long and the training walks short!</h4>
